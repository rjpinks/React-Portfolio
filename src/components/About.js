            I'm just a simple guy living in rural Illinois with an interest in computers. I am a veteran, and I consider myself a life-long learner. I served three-and-a-half years in the infantry, and I was stationed out of Schofield Barracks, Hi. Afterwards, I began to pursue a career in Education. I received my Bachelor's Degree in History with a minor in French. After doing some assistant teaching in Rib√©rac, France, I decided to shift career paths towards programming. Besides the things that I've already mentioned, I've also worked in steel mills, warehouses, restaurants and retail, so I'm a hard worker with communication skills!
