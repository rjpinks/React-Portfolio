            I'm just a simple guy living in rural Illinois with an interest in computers. I am a veteran. I served three-and-a-half years in the infantry stationed out of Schofield Barracks, Hi. Afterwards, I began to pursue a career in education. I received my Bachelor's Degree in History with a minor in French. After doing some assistant teaching in Rib√©rac, France, I decided to shift careers towards programming.
